# rotate_image

This is a simple image rotation utility provided by Ohad Gal. It is hosted here for convenience and updating, but can easily be found on the [MATLAB central file exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4071-rotate-image/content/rotate_image.m). It is useful because it avoids the need for the image processing toolbox for the operation of image rotation.
